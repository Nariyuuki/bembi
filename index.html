      🌸 Hi! Good morning good afternoon and good evening to you! 🌸<br><br>
      We've been through a lot stuff, so much stuff but we're still here! Still together! <br><br>
      Maybe I'm speechless by the fact that we've overcome so much together in our lives regardless if we're far apart. <br><br>
     I've found the root cause of all the actions in this world, Sam. It was actually such a simple answer, emotions! Our different emotions guide us to different actions that our mind deem worthy of it. <br><br>
     So in happiness, it's alignment! Your heart is aligned with all the wonderful things this world could offer, they are aligned with your desires, values, dreams, and sense of self. <br><br>
     In fear, you'll know what are the things you wouldn't want to lose, it gives them meaning special to you, close to your heart.  <br><br>
     In sadness? The sense that you've lost something you valued, may it be yourself, something, or someone. To be hurt is to be loved, in every sadness present, there was once a heart fulfilled. <br><br>
     Pretty cool if I do say so myself haha. <br><br>
     Lastly, anger, the line between order and chaos, in my opinion, this is the most important one of them all. It signifies where your boundaries are strictly lined! You might think of it as a bad emotion, that it only leads to chaos and destruction, but there is always beauty in everything we do. <br><br>
     And In everything that I've said, you'll see a part of little you just wanting you to be at peace, someone who will shed a tear with you, and someone who doesn't want the present Samshi to be hurt. You have to protect her with all of your life even if it means opposing the world! After all there is beauty in everything!  <br><br>
     Though sometimes, that beauty shines so brightly, so intensely that it's aggressive yet warm and tender. You've been reading this for quite a long time now, and I hope that you know, that I'm talking about you. You are that beauty that shines the brightest, regardless if we are far apart, I can feel your faint radiance embedded on my wrist. Sometimes, even when you're far away, I see things that are little parts of you, how glad I felt when I realized, that you are a part of me too. Regardless if the world beats you down, I'll just be here with you. As long as you allow me, I'll strive my best to give you my everything, samshi. xoxo yuuki! </3 Thank you for being my favorite thought.  <br><br>
