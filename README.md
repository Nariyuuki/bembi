This is a readme for ME, imma do it some other time, but when I input some mp3 file it still wont work when I click on anything, 

what you need to do: 
find an audio that can be put in the code
realize what links can be used
and find out if its about the new feature of chrome with the anti cross link cookie thingy

THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE AUDIO THAT WONT PLAY, I USE AUDIO BLOCK UNTIL CLICK SO IT'LL WORK BETTER BUT IT STILL WONT WORK.
